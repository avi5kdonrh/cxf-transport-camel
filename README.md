# Camel CXF Example

### Introduction

This example shows how to work with CXF and Camel.

This uses cxf transport with camel. So instead of offering a direct CXF service with http/jms protocol, it binds cxf service address to a camel direct endpoint.

### Build

You will need to compile this example first:

	mvn compile

### Run


	mvn exec:java -PCamelTransport
